# iExcercise

## Description

Motivation: The motivation behind building iExercise was to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to explore and save exercise videos based on different criteria such as exercise type, muscle group, and difficulty level.

Why: The goal was to provide users with a tool that makes it easy to find workout routines tailored to their preferences and save their favorite exercise videos for quick access.

Problem it Solves: iExercise addresses the challenge of discovering relevant exercise videos by integrating external APIs to fetch exercise information and corresponding YouTube videos. It simplifies the process of finding and saving workout routines.

What I Learned: During the development of iExercise, I gained experience in working with external APIs, managing data dynamically, and enhancing the user experience with interactive features.
